  /*  100% is equal to the Current Font Size - 16px & Percents are also scalable like ems.
    Think of it this way: 1.5em is 1.5 times larger, and 150% is 150 percent of the font size. 
    Percents are also good for mobile development because of their scalability.

      we want the root font size to be 10px so dividing 10 / 16 = 0.625, .625 * 16 = 10px.
      Note - if we want to make a change to the Root default font size to be 20px, 
       20 / 16 = 1.25, 1.25 * 16 = 20px 
       font-size: 125%; // 20px
